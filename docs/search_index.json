[["index.html", "Standardized Testing Chapter 1 Introduction", " Standardized Testing Haolong Liu, Imani Oluwafumilayo Maliti 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction The SAT is a standardized test used by colleges and universities in the United States to assess the academic readiness of applicants and possibly grant them acceptance to their institution. The test is allegedly designed to measure a student’s critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytic skills. Moreover, it is typically taken by high school juniors and seniors. The SAT currently consists of three main sections: Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. Scores on the SAT are used by colleges as part of their admissions process, as students with high SAT scores are expected to perform better throughout their undergraduate matriculation. Nevertheless, with this project, we strive to determine if the SATs are a strong and fair indicator of college readiness and performance. We will use data visualizations to show the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA, and compare its strength to the relationship between college GPAhigh school GPA (another alleged strong indicator of college performance). Furthermore, we introduce other factors to be considered, such as gender, overall GPA and first-year GPA, and the breakdown of SAT scores. This way, we can dive deeper to examine the relationships. Additionally, we will also analyze state-wise SAT scores in United States and delve deeper into the potential demographic biases of the SATs using extensive state-level data for California, a state with one of the biggest populations and biggest education systems in the country. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic What are the determinants of high school students’ ability to succeed in college? One may argue that high school GPA is a statistically sound predictor. However, others may say that the Scholastic Aptitude Test (i.e, SAT) is a better one. Nevertheless, the question remains whether or not either are actually accurate of students’ preparedness for and performance in college. In this research project, we seek answers for the following questions: What is the relationship between SAT score and college GPA? Is high school GPA a better predictor for college GPA than SAT scores? Is the SAT even an unbias and consistent-enough measure to predict college performance in the first place? Conducting this research may help students better understand how to viably prepare for their journey in higher education. Also, studying how the SAT’s effect college success (or lack thereof) may also guide us to think deeper about the current admission systems. Examining differences in demographics could aid in taking a closer at the fairness of the admission system in terms of gender diversity. The reason we choose to analyze the SAT only is because it is the most common standardized test in the United States; moreover, focusing on one test increases the consistency of the data. 2.2 Data availability 2.2.1 Dataset 1: 1000 anonymous students’ SAT and GPA This dataset was collected by Chance, a quantitative literacy course developed cooperatively by the Chance Team: J. Laurie Snell and Peter Doyle of Dartmouth College, Joan Garfield of the University of Minnesota, Tom Moore of Grinnell College, Bill Peterson of Middlebury College, and Ngambal Shah of Spelman College. The dataset collects 1000 anonymous students’ gender, SAT scores, high-school GPA, and first-year college GPA. The raw data is directly accessible from the following link: https://chance.dartmouth.edu/course/Syllabi/Princeton96/ETSValidation.html 2.2.2 Dataset 2: Dartmouth Male and Female Students who take Psychology Courses’ SAT and GPA These two datasets are collected by the same source, Chance. Attributes include SAT verbal, SAT math scores, SAT scores, total GPA, major GPA, and two Psych courses’ GPA. The two datasets represent male students and female students respectively and are collected at the same time. These datasets are small-scaled and are not updated. They are accessible through the following links: https://chance.dartmouth.edu/course/Syllabi/Princeton96/Dartmouth.men.html https://chance.dartmouth.edu/course/Syllabi/Princeton96/Dartmouth.women.html Including the first dataset with these, we could analyze the extent to which high-school GPAs and SAT scores help students succeed in college. Furthermore, we can identify which one is a more important factor. Since we have students’ genders, we can also compare results between two genders and see whether a significant difference exists or not. 2.2.3 Dataset 3: 2018 SAT Annual Report States Average SAT Scores in 2018. This data set is published by College Board, the 2018 SAT Suite of Assessments Annual Report, and it is accessible from https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results. The Attributes include: State: states of united states. Participation: Participation rate of students in each state for SAT exam. Evidence-Based Reading and Writing: State Average of SAT Verbal scores. Math: State Average of SAT Math scores. Total: State Average of total SAT scores. The dataset contains 51 records. It counts District of Columbia as a State. 2.2.4 Dataset 4: California SAT Reports from 1998 to 2016 Each state in the United States has its own Department of Education that creates reports on SAT scores by district and school. Take California’s report for example. This dataset is collected by the California Department of Education (CDE). CDE receives California public school students’ SAT scores from the College Board, then groups the data by school, district, country, and state to produce California SAT Report. Scores for schools that had fewer than eleven students taking the SAT are not shown on the SAT Report to preserve the anonymity of the students. The report includes geographical information and a breakdown of average SAT scores. Data attributes include school, district, county, number of takers, average reading, writing, math scores, and percent of test takers whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500. With this dataset, we can analyze whether California students are doing better over time. Also, since the datasets cover a longer time period, we could possibly do a time-series analysis on how California’s SAT scores changed over time. Furthermore, a state-wise comparison of SAT scores may also help us understand the fairness of admissions in the United States. The data is accessible through the following link: https://data.world/education/california-sat-reports/workspace/intro 2.2.5 Dataset 5: KidsData.org California Demographic Data From KidsData.org, we collected three of their California-specific datasets, all of which were broken down by the same Counties in the California SAT Report data. The first dataset is Child Population, by County by Race/Ethnicity. The table reports the percentage of children who identify with a list of races in each county from 1995 to 2021. The total options for race breakdown are the following: African American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White, and Multiracial. The dataset also provides the option to review this data in the format of count as opposed to percentage. The data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/33/child-population-race/table#fmt=144&amp;loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=141&amp;ch=7,11,70,10,72,9,73 The second dataset is Child Population, by County by Age Group and Gender. Similarly to the previous dataset, it reports the percentage (or count) of children who identify with a list of age groups and genders in each county from 1995 to 2021. The following are all the options for age groups: Ages 0-2, Ages 3-5, Ages 6-10, Ages 11-13, Ages 14-17, and Total for Ages 0-17. The options for gender are Female and Male. The data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/34/child-population-age-gender/table#fmt=141&amp;loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=141&amp;ch=1433,926,927,1434,1435,372,78,77,79 The final dataset is Children in Poverty, by Race/Ethnicity (Regions of 10,000 Residents or More). The table reports the percentage of children who live in poverty in each county from 2005 to 2018. The options for race and ethnicity are consistent with the first dataset. The data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/544/poverty-race-10k/table#fmt=727&amp;loc=2,127,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=132&amp;ch=7,11,726,10,72,9,73,1298 With these datasets, we can observe if there are any underlying demographic biases that contribute to higher SAT scores—despite the fact that ethically, we believe these demographics are not determinants of intelligence and thus, academic performance. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data We have used multiple datasets for this project, and Each of them will be explained below. 3.1 Sources 3.1.1 DataSet 1: 1000 anonymous students’ SAT and GPA This dataset was collected by Chance, a quantitative literacy course developed cooperatively by the Chance Team: J. Laurie Snell and Peter Doyle of Dartmouth College, Joan Garfield of the University of Minnesota, Tom Moore of Grinnell College, Bill Peterson of Middlebury College, and Ngambal Shah of Spelman College. The raw data is directly accessible from the following link: https://chance.dartmouth.edu/course/Syllabi/Princeton96/ETSValidation.html The dataset collects 1000 anonymous students’ gender, SAT scores, high-school GPA, and first-year college GPA. Format of the data A data frame with 1000 observations on the following 6 variables: sex: Gender of the student. sat_v: Verbal SAT percentile. sat_m: Math SAT percentile. sat_sum: Total of verbal and math SAT percentiles. hs_gpa: High school grade point average. fy_gpa: First year (college) grade point average. Total number of records 1000 Problem with the data The data does not give direct SAT scores.Rather, it gives the percentile of SAT scores. Therefore, normalizations might be applied before using. 3.1.2 Dataset 2: Dartmouth Male and Female Students who take Psychology Courses’ SAT and GPA These two datasets are collected by the same source as the prior dataset, Chance. Its attributes include SAT verbal, SAT math scores, SAT scores, total GPA, major GPA, and two Psych courses’ GPA.

For decades, the CDE received California public school students’ SAT scores from the College Board, then groups the data by school, district, country, and state to produce California SAT Report. Scores for schools that had fewer than eleven students taking the SAT are not shown on the SAT Report to preserve the anonymity of the students. The report includes geographical information and a breakdown of average SAT scores. The data is accessible through the following link: https://data.world/education/california-sat-reports/workspace/intro Format of the data The dataset is a series of excel files that contain the following variable names—some of which have varying names across files representing the same type of data: County Number: the Californian ID number for a specified county District Number: the Californian ID number for a specified district School Number: the Californian ID number for a specified high school cds: the Californian ID number for a specified county, district, or school rtype: the type of level the row specifies information for (i.e., county, district, or school) County Name (or cname) District Name (or dname) School Name (or sname): the name of high schools Grade 12 Enrollment (or Grade 12 or enroll12): the number of high school seniors in a specified school Number of Takers (or Number Tested or NumTstTakr): the number of high school seniors who took the SAT Percent of Takers (or Percent Tested): the percentage of high school seniors who took the SAT out of total high school seniors in the school Average Verbal Score (or V_Mean or AvgScrRead): the average score for the verbal/reading section of the SAT in a specified high school Average Math Score (or M_Mean or AvgScrMath): the average score for the mathematics section of the SAT in a specified high school Average Writing Score (or W_Mean or AvgScrWrit): the average score for the Writing section of the SAT in a specified high school, for tests from 2005 onward Average Total Score (or Tot_Mean): the average total score for the SAT in a specified high school Number w/Score &gt;=1000: the number of high school seniors who took the SAT and scored at least averagely, for tests before 2005 Number w/Score &gt;=1500 (or GE1500Ct or NumGE1500): the number of high school seniors who took the SAT and scored at least averagely, for tests from 2005 onward Percent w/Score &gt;=1000: the percentage of high school seniors who took the SAT and scored at least averagely, for tests before 2005, out of the total number of high school seniors who took the SAT Percent w/Score &gt;=1500 (or Rate1500 or PctGE1500): the percentage of high school seniors who took the SAT and scored at least averagely, for tests from 2005 onward, out of the total number of high school seniors who took the SAT year: the academic year that the input correlates to Problem with the data The variables of this dataset reflect the several changes and shifts in the standard formats of the CDE. To make all of the datasets consistent took a lot of calculations and cross-checking. Additionally, for some schools, the number of students taking the SAT was so minute that the data was not recorded in the set. As a result, there are quite a few missing values, as we’ll discover later on in this section. Lastly, the SAT added the writing section to the exam in 2005, thus changing the maximum score from 1600 to 2400 and the average threshold from 1000 to 1500. This must be taken into account when creating scales for the cleaned data and visualizations. Choosing what years and variables to work with Altogether, there were 18 data sets from 1998 to 2016—each of them encompassing the SAT scores of high school students in California graduating in an academic year (e.g., 1999-2000, 2005-2006). Because of the large number of data sets, we have chosen to focuse half of those datasets, all of which have a starting year that is 2 years prior to the next used data set. In terms of variables, we have chosen to look at the data on the level of County, since it allowed for more opportunities in using other data sets in addition to this one for analysis. Since our object of focus is mainly the SAT scores, we chose to mainly focus on the number of test takers, the average scores for all sections, the average total score, and the percentage of test takers who scored at least an average score (i.e., 1000 for test before 2005 and 1500 for test from 2005 onward). 3.1.5 Dataset 5: KidsData.org’s Child Population, by County by Race/Ethnicity The first dataset is Child Population, by County by Race/Ethnicity. The table reports the percentage of children who identify with a list of races in each county from 1995 to 2021. The total options for race breakdown are the following: African American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White, and Multiracial. The dataset also provides the option to review this data in the format of count as opposed to percentage. The full data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/33/child-population-race/table#fmt=144&amp;loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=141&amp;ch=7,11,70,10,72,9,73 Choosing what years and variables to work with For this dataset, we found it best to test bias by determining if the percentage of white children in a county had any correlation with the SAT statistics, considering that being white is considered the societal and academic “norm”. Thus, we downloaded the data such that it represented the percentage of white children within each county of California. We also made sure that it covered data for 2005 to 2013, since it would remain consistent with our other Californian demographoc datasets later on. Format of the data The dataset is a CSV file with 291 lines and the following variables: FIPSCode: the Californian ID number for a specified county LocationType: the geographic level at which the data is presented (i.e., county) Location: county name Race_Ethnicity: the race/ethnicity for which the statistic represents (i.e., white) TimeFrame: year DateFormat: the type of statistic (i.e., percent or number/count) Data: the statistic value 3.1.6 Dataset 6: KidsData.org’s Child Population, by County by Age Group and Gender The second dataset is Child Population, by County by Age Group and Gender. Similarly to the previous dataset, it reports the percentage (or count) of children who identify with a list of age groups and genders in each county from 1995 to 2021. The following are all the options for age groups: Ages 0-2, Ages 3-5, Ages 6-10, Ages 11-13, Ages 14-17, and Total for Ages 0-17. The options for gender are Female and Male. The data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/34/child-population-age-gender/table#fmt=141&amp;loc=2,127,347,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,323,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,333,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=141&amp;ch=1433,926,927,1434,1435,372,78,77,79 Choosing what years and variables to work with For this dataset, we found it best to test bias by determining if the percentage of male children in a county had any correlation with the SAT statistics, considering that being male is considered the societal and academic “norm”. Thus, we downloaded the data such that it represented the total count of male children within each county of California. We also made sure that it covered data for 2005 to 2013, since it would remain consistent with our other Californian demographoc datasets later on. Format of the data The dataset is a CSV file with 291 lines and the following variables: FIPSCode: the Californian ID number for a specified county LocationType: the geographic level at which the data is presented (i.e., county) Location: county name AgeGroup: the specified age group for which the inputs in this row represent (i.e., all ages) Gender: the “gender” for which the statistic represent (i.e., Male) TimeFrame: year DateFormat: the type of statistic (i.e., number/count) Data: the statistic value 3.1.7 Dataset 7: KidsData.org’s Children in Poverty, by Race/Ethnicity (Regions of 10,000 Residents or More The final dataset is Children in Poverty, by Race/Ethnicity (Regions of 10,000 Residents or More). The table reports the percentage of children who live in poverty in each county from 2005 to 2018. The options for race and ethnicity are consistent with the first dataset. The data is accessible through the following link: https://www.kidsdata.org/topic/544/poverty-race-10k/table#fmt=727&amp;loc=2,127,1763,331,348,336,171,321,345,357,332,324,369,358,362,360,337,327,364,356,217,353,328,354,352,320,339,334,365,343,330,367,344,355,366,368,265,349,361,4,273,59,370,326,322,341,338,350,342,329,325,359,351,363,340,335&amp;tf=132&amp;ch=7,11,726,10,72,9,73,1298 Format of the data The dataset is a CSV file with 291 lines and the following variables: FIPSCode: the Californian ID number for a specified county LocationType: the geographic level at which the data is presented (i.e., county) Location: county name Race_Ethnicity: the race/ethnicity for which the statistic represents (i.e., All Children) TimeFrame: year DateFormat: the type of statistic (i.e., number/count) Data: the statistic value Problem with the data There are missing values for certain years and not others, which affects consistency with results. Unfortunately, we were not able to find other sources that could fill in this missing data and there is no way to infer what the values may have been. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.2.1 Datasets 1, 2, and 3 The variable sat_sum is the sum of sat_v and sat_m, but since both sat_v and sat_m are percentiles, such summations may be problematic because percentiles differs from percentiles of sum. In this case, we actually want percentiles of sum; thus, we will simply divide this column by 2 to represent percentiles of sum, because verbal and math takes the same proportion in SAT scores. Sex is represented using 1 and 0, where 1 represents male and 0 for female. We need to change it to actual gender. The data stores males and females’ scores separately. We have to download it, save it to csv, and combine them together and add gender attribute to it. To apply mapping in R, we need to change state names to lower letter, and we need to change percentage char to numeric. 3.2.2 Dataset 4 We started by loading the data of all the excel files. Note, in those lines, we specified the inputs that represented missing values (e.g., *, NA, - -, 0). For all of the datasets except SAT2013 and SAT 2015, we did not specify that the first row contains the column names because the originally downloaded datasets contain rows above the headers that are not column rows. To ensure a reproducible workflow, we decided to fix these problems in R as opposed to removing the excess rows manually. In the following cell, we will add those column names. By now, we’ve noticed that the structure for the data sets from 1999 to 2011 are different from 2013 and 2015, despite the fact that they were all downloaded from the same source. For the consistency, and ease, of our analyses, we will transform these data sets to showcase the the averages of the following variables per county: number of test takers average verbal score (or average critical reading score, for tests from 2005 onward) average mathematics score average writing score, for tests from 2005 onward; otherwise, it’s 0 for all of test years total average percentage of test takers who scored equal to or greater than the widely value for an averagely competitive score (1000 for before 2005 and 1500 after) Because there are the missing SAT statistics are of no use to this analysis, and there is no way to infer or fill in what those missing values are, we will remove them. Additionally, to allow for a smoother process for calling variables, we will be removing and replacing whitespaces and other symbols in variable names. It is important to note that for 2015, there’s only 56 counties because all three of Sierra’s inputs did not have any scores (i.e., they were all NAs). Now, we will create a cohesive dataframe of the average SAT statistics for each year that will be used for visualizations in the next section. ## # A tibble: 9 × 9 ## year avg_per_takers avg_verbal avg_math avg_writing avg_total max_score avg_per_thresh avg_total_per ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1999 40.3 494. 504. 0 998. 1600 21.1 62.4 ## 2 2001 40.7 490. 502. 0 993. 1600 20.9 62.0 ## 3 2003 38.7 499. 509. 0 1008. 1600 21.2 63.0 ## 4 2005 39.1 495. 506. 492. 1494. 2400 19.4 62.2 ## 5 2007 39.9 493. 502. 486. 1480. 2400 46.5 61.7 ## 6 2009 40.1 501. 510. 495. 1505. 2400 50.6 62.7 ## 7 2011 44.3 492. 501. 485. 1477. 2400 45.3 61.6 ## 8 2013 44.4 495. 498. 485. 1478. 2400 45.6 61.6 ## 9 2015 45.5 492. 494. 478. 1464. 2400 44.3 61.0 3.2.3 Dataset 5 Note, for all the KidsData.org datasets, the following years were chosen as years of interests based on 1) results from the analyses of Dataset 4 and 2) their high frequency of availability in demographic datasets: 2005, 2009, 2013. To clean this dataset, the CSV files will simply be read. 3.2.4 Datasets 6 To clean this dataset, the CSV files for each year will simply be read. 3.2.5 Datasets 7 Unlike the previous two datasets, this dataset has missing values that must accounted for and properly dealt with. This involves reading the CSV file and specifying the NA characters. Then, the data has to be split to three different data frames, each containing all of the data for our years of interest. Then, we will remove rows with NAs and identify the intersection of counties from the dataframe with no NAs and the data frame from Dataset 4 representing the average SAT statistics by year. Finally, the poverty statistics for those intersecting counties will be subset and ordered alphabetically.

However, in the following years, the pattern is not as straight forward. There are two main reasons why this is so. First, the CDE changed the way it formatted its datasets. As a result, we start getting more group-leveled data, instead of just school-specific data for each row. This means that we are also accounting for rows that only have district data and county data, and thus miss other variables in the row. Additionally, the CDE and College Board numeric standards for which schools, districts, and counties they report SAT data for changed over the years—thus resulting in some schools, districts, and counties being included in the sheet, but not having any inputs. 3.3.2 Dataset 5 There are no missing values in this dataset. ## FIPSCode LocationType Location Race_Ethnicity TimeFrame DataFormat Data ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3.3.3 Dataset 6 There are no missing values in any of these datasets. ## FIPSCode LocationType Location AgeGroup Gender TimeFrame DataFormat Data ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## FIPSCode LocationType Location AgeGroup Gender TimeFrame DataFormat Data ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## FIPSCode LocationType Location AgeGroup Gender TimeFrame DataFormat Data ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3.3.4 Dataset 7 For this dataset, we see that there is a smaller number of missing data from the original, uncleaned dataset. Upon further examination, we recognized that many of the missing data values are from counties that did not meet the threshold of having at least ten thousand residents for the years of interest. ## FIPSCode LocationType Location Race_Ethnicity TimeFrame DataFormat Data ## 0 0 0 0 0 0 35 "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Correlation between SAT Scores and College GPA 4.2 Multidimensional Analysis 4.3 State-wise Analysis 4.4 Analysis of California SAT Statistics over time 4.5 Analysis of Potential Demographic Biases of SAT", " Chapter 4 Results In this section, we will use exploratory data analysis to show relationships between high school GPA, SAT scores, and college GPA. 4.1 Correlation between SAT Scores and College GPA We first plot scatter plots to show correlations between SAT scores and college GPA. We can see from the graph that there is a positive correlation between SAT scores and college GPA. This means that, in general, students who score well on the SAT tend to have high GPAs in college. However, it’s important to note that this relationship is not perfect, because the dots are rather scattered. We also introduced students’ gender in the plot, and we can see that female students tend to have slightly higher GPAs than male students, despite the fact that this difference is small. ## SATV SATM CGPA MGPA Psych1 Psych10 SAT SEX ##

[ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 486 rows ] We then plotted Letter grade VS SAT scores. Taking a breakdown of GPA helps us understand how SAT scores truly affect College performance. The skewness of plots varies with regard to letter grades, and while most of them have one peak, C+ and C- have two peaks. It is very obvious that students with lower SAT scores perform worse most of the times, but students with higher SAT scores are not guranteed to perform better. For example, with a SAT score of 1300, the probability of him/she receives C- or B+ is similar. The information could help the admission in that while students with higher SAT scores should be considered with high priority, but as long as they pass the bar, other qualities will matter more than one simple score. 4.2 Multidimensional Analysis In the plot, we used parallel coordinate plots to show relationship between high school GPA, College GPA, and SAT scores. To make our audiences easy to observe the relationship, we put College GPA in the middle. We can see that most of the times, both high school GPA and SAT scores are strong positively correlated with College GPA. Females have performed better as more of them are on the top of the graph. From the slope of the graph, we can see that high school GPA is slightly more positively correlated with college GPA, which means that high school GPA is a stronger indicator than SAT scores, but the differences are not very obvious. The positive relationships are not perfect, as there are many instances of high SAT scores or high school GPA that leads to low college GPA. 4.3 State-wise Analysis In the state-wise analysis, we plotted, using spatial data, the average SAT performance of each state and its participation rates. As we can observe, SAT scores can vary greatly from one state to another. This could be due to on a variety of factors, such as the quality of the schools, the level of funding they receive, and the socioeconomic backgrounds of the students who take the test. However, one interesting finds here is that there seems to be negative correlations between average SAT scores and participation rates, which could be counter intuitive, because it is natural to think that higher participation rates mean the state does a good job at preparing its students for standardized tests. Total SAT score histogram is symmetrical with one peak. Majority of them performed averagely, and none performed very well or very poorly.SAT Math score histogram is skewed to the left. More students perform poorly, and only very few perform very well. The histograms for SAT verbal are bimodal, indicating that students tend to perform either very poorly or very well. 4.4 Analysis of California SAT Statistics over time For this analysis, we started by creating two heat maps. We originallt wanted to make time series; however, for certain variables, the line graphs showcased a gradual incline from year to year, as opposed to the sharp increase that it was (i.e., the increase from a 0-valued Average writing score for tests before 2005 to the Average writing score to 2005, since the writing section did not exist prior to that year). To stay truthful to the data, we instead opted for a heat map to show to differences, or lack thereof, over time. The first showcases the patterns by year across the three main, non-percentage SAT statistics (i.e., Average Writing Score, Average Reading Score, and Average Math Score). The second showcases the patterns by year across the two main, percentage-based SAT statistics (i.e., Average total score represented as a percentage of the maximum possible score and the Average percentage of test takers who had at least an average score). These two maps were split as opposed to being joined together because they are on different scales—the first having variables that exist on a scale from 0 to 800 and the second from 0 to 100. Thus, to better understand what the data shows us, we provided the seperate heat maps. We see from the first heat map that all of the scores for all of the sections seem to be very similar in value, and thus in hue. The only exception are the writing scores prior to 2005, which are all 0 because the writing section did not exist in those years. Just to ensure that the values are indeed similar and there is nothing wrong with the data, we created a barchart as evidence to our claim that there is no general difference in averages per section over the years. We then moved on to look at the pecerntage data. For the second heatmap, we witness the same general pattern for the first variable (i.e.,Average total score represented as a percentage of the maximum possible score), in the sense that the values are very similar throughout the years; However, the variable representing the average percentage of test takers who had at least an average score has a lot more variability. There are two distinct sections of that part of the heat map. All of the years prior to 2007 have very low values, while every year onward is significantly higher, with the highest being in 2009. This helps prove to us that although the changes in SAT standards did not effect the average scoring on each section, it did drastically affect the possibility of attaining at least an averagely competitive score. Therefore, it is sound to question how reliable using the SAT as a predictor of college performance is considering that its numerous shifts do alter how students perform. 4.5 Analysis of Potential Demographic Biases of SAT For this analysis, we created a series of scatter plots to determine the following: does there exist any correlations between the average percentage of students within a county that achieve at least an average score and the percentages of specific socioeconomic demographics among children in said county? We pose this question, and its results, to see if SAT scores hold any bias. Our belief is that if SATs are widely used as a measure of college readiness and future academic performance, then it should be consistent amongst all races, genders, and economic incomes. Thus, there should not exist a correlation between these demographics that do not determine someone’s intelligence and test that supposedly does. When looking for data sets to represent the measures for these socioeconomic children demographics in California, most of them had data that only dated back to 2005. Thus, based on this fact and the heat maps from the previous analysis, we decided to use data that represented the following years: 2005, 2009, and 2013. The year 2005 had the lowest average percent of students that achieved at least an average score, while 2009 had the highest, and 2013 was in the middle. ### Race We start by looking at our Child Population, by County by Race/Ethnicity datasest. For ease and consistency, we specifically looked at data that showed the percentage of white children in a county for each year of interest. This is because in academia and society at large, whiteness is often chosen to be the “standard of normality”. Any positive correlations between the percentage of white children and the average percent of students that achieved at least an average score will in turn mean that there is a negative correlation for the percentage of children belonging to marginalized race communities. In 2005, we see that there is a slight positive correlation between the two variables. The data shows that in this year, the higher the percent of white children in a county, the higher the average percent of students in that achieved at least an average score—which is inherently bias. However, this graph alone does not seem to have a terribly strong correlation, and thus, we will continue to look at the other years to see if the trend continues or if this is a stand-alone event. As we see here, in 2009 and 2015, not only does the trend continue, but its correlation becomes blatantly prominent. Both of these graphs continue to showcase that the higher the percent of white children in a county, the higher the average percent of students in that achieved at least an average score. This means that children attending schools in counties with higher percentages of non-white children are at a disadvantage, which is once again inherently bias. This rules out the SAT being considered a fair measure, at least when considering race. 4.5.1 Gender Following, we looked at our Child Population, by County by Age Group and Gender dataset. Once again, for ease and consistency, we specifically looked at data that showed the percentage of male children in a county for each year of interest. Similar to our last analysis, we chose this because in academia and society at large, being male is often associated as the “standard of normality”. Any positive correlations between the percentage of male children and the average percent of students that achieved at least an average score will in turn mean that there is a negative correlation for the percentage of female children. Note, the scales for these two graphs, and the upcoming 2013 one, are different. We thought about making them cohesive so that readers may be able to easily read the values for each plot without having to reevaluate what the scales are; however, because there is such a huge difference in minimum and maximum values for each, making all of them on consistent scales would make it harder to see the trends in some. Moreover, we are more concerened about the movement/trends of the points, rather than the value the points hold themselves. With these scatter plots, we see that in 2005 and 2009, there is a negative correlation between the two variables. The data shows that in these years, the higher the percent of male children in a county, the lower the average percent of students in that achieved at least an average score. While this is bias, it was not the type of bias that we had originally hypothesized considering the undisputed misogynistic nature and history of academia. We also thought this was interesting since most of the counties have a majority (i.e., over 50%) of male children. It’s interesting to see that not even the number of males possibly taking the SAT would increase their chances of collectively scoring higher (or at least average). Upon looking at the plots some more, we also noticed that in both graphs there are sections on the x-axis where the points are more densely populated and take up larger ranges on the y-axis. In 2005, the counties with anywhere from 51 to 52 percent of male children 1) were the vast majority of the data and 2) had y-values from as low 5% to as high as 45%. In 2009, we see a similar trend with the counties that had around the same percentages of male children; however, their y-values ranged from under 30% to almost 80%. It can be argued that because of these densely populated areas on the plot, it’s harder for us to truly determine if there is a correlation based on visualizations alone. This may call for a much deeper analysis, or simply more extensive data. Nevertheless, we showcase our results for 2013, as well. As we see here, in 2013, the possible correlation trend does not continue. In fact, there does not seem to be any correlation with the data for this year. Nevertheless, we do see the majority of values with the largest y-value ranges within that 51% to 52% range. While these visualization do not necessarily provide evidence that the SAT may not be considered a fair measure when considering gender, it does bring up grounds to do further research on. 4.5.2 Poverty We start by looking at our Children in Poverty, by Race/Ethnicity (Regions of 10,000 Residents or More) dataset. Specifically, this dataset showed us the percentage of children in a county living in poverty for each year of interest. Any begative correlations between the percentage of impoverished (i.e., poor) children and the average percent of students that achieved at least an average score will in turn mean that there is a positive correlation for the percentage of children belonging to more financially stable households. In 2005, we see that there is a drastic negative correlation between the two variables. The data shows that in this year, the higher the percent of impoverished children in a county, the lower the average percent of students in that achieved at least an average score. This means that children who attend schools in counties with higher percentages of children in poverty are at a disadvantage, which is inherently bias. Nevertheless, we will continue to look at the other years to see if the trend continues or if this is a stand-alone event. As we see here, in 2009 and 2015, not only does the trend continue, but its correlation stays prominent. Both of these graphs continue to showcase that the higher the percent of impoverished children in a county, the lower the average percent of students in that achieved at least an average score. This means that children attending schools in counties with higher percentages of non-white children are at a disadvantage, which is once again inherently bias. Altogether, these graphs serve as evidence that rules out the SAT being considered a fair measure, at least when considering income status. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component In this section, we created an interactive visualization to accompany our research and results, which was created and shared via the Vizhub platform. It is a chloropleth map that shows the average SAT scores of each State in United States when the mouse hover on it. This map is accesible through the following link: https://vizhub.com/LONGLONGTOM/be7e78a2963d44b0aab8996a4c5c1bae?edit=files "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takeaways of Exploration 6.2 Limitations 6.3 Future Directions", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Main Takeaways of Exploration Overall, we concluded that SAT scores are not the best metric to predict how students perform in college. Although there is some correlation between high SAT scores and high college GPAs, there is an even stronger indicator when utilizing high school GPAs instead. In terms of the California SAT Analyses, we determined that the shifts and changes in SAT standards changes (i.e., the adding of sections and increase of maximum score) did not have a substantial effect on the average score per section over the years. Neither did it have an effect on the ratio of the average total score to the maximum possible score for that year. However, it did have varying effects on the average percentage of students who achieved at least an average SAT score—with years from 2005 below scoring have the lowest percentage, 2009 having the highest, and every other year ranking high as well. With this taken into consideration, we were able to determine that the SATs have biases, as those who are apart of certain socioeconomically disadvantaged counties are less likely to achieve average SAT scores. Specifically, our data showed that students who are not white and impoverished students are at sever disadvantages. Because these demographics do not have an effect on an individual’s academic ability, but do have an effect on how high the score on an SAT, we concluded that the SAT is not fair enough to be used as a metric of college performance and readiness, race and household income considered. 6.2 Limitations One of our more blatant limitations, especially in the later analyses, were the missing values in SAT and demographic data. In Dataset 4, we saw that for some the years, though the amount of schools or counties with missing data was not substantial in comparison to the filled values, it was still a large number. As there was no way for us to fill in or assume the missing data values, this may have affected our project’s results in unknown ways. Another limitation was also not being able to find readily accessible demographic datasets prior to 2005—which meant there there was an entire era of the SATs (in terms of standards and scores) that were not able to identify possible bias trends for. Doing this would have allowed for a fuller picture of the story the data conveyed. Lastly, another limitation was only having access to the Princeton96 datasets from Chance. Despite it being a wonderful dataset to work with for the sake of our project, it was collected from students from Princeton—an ivy league with very rigorous testing standards. This may have presented some unknown bias to our results. Moreover, the dataset was last updated in 2013. It would have been nice to have access to a more recent study as well, and create visualizations comparing the two, thus creating a fuller-picture story. 6.3 Future Directions If we were to take future steps for this project, we would look into the trends and visualizations of more recent school data and data from other types of schools (i.e., not just ivy leagues). We would also do a deeper dive into the gender analysis, as the data we had access to may not have beene extensive enough for us to come to a conclusion. As inspiried by our limitations, we would also look into the SAT trends from before 2005 standard change. Moreover, we think it would be interesting to look at the trends from after the 2016 standard change, in addition the trends from the pandemic (sinnce standardized testing was not required for admission for many schools).
