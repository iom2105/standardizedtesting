# Proposal

## Research topic
SAT, a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States, whether it
is only for admission purposes or it actually helps students prepare colleges is always an
interesting question. Additionally, high school GPA or SAT, whether one is more important in
success in college is also debated frequently. It comes with no surprise that there is a
positive relationship between SAT and college GPA, but there are still areas to dive deeper.
For example, is the correlation strong? Is high school GPA a better predictor than SAT? Also,
does it apply to both males and females? In this research project, we seek answers for the
above questions. Conducting this research helps students understanding the reasons they
study for standardized tests, which could be beyond purely admissions. Studying how SAT
works for college success may also guide a way to change the test corresponding or guide
us to think deeper about the current admission systems. Examinng the gender differences
could help use look closer at fairness of the admission system in terms of diversity. The
reason we choose to analyze SAT only is because SAT is the most commonly used
standardized tests in United States and focusing on one test increases consistency of the
data.

## Data availability
### Datasets 1: 1000 anonymous students’ SAT and GPA
This datasets was collected by Chance, a quantitative literacy course developed
cooperatively by the Chance Team: J. Laurie Snell and Peter Doyle of Dartmouth College,
Joan Garfield of the University of Minnesota, Tom Moore of Grinnell College, Bill Peterson of
Middlebury College, and Ngambal Shah of Spelman College. The datasets collects 1000 anonymous students’ gender, SAT scores, high-school GPA, and first-year college GPA. The
raw data is directly accessible from the following link:\\

### Datasets2: Dartmouth Male and Female Students who take Psychology Courses’s SAT and GPA
These two datasets are collected by the same source, Chance. Attributes include SAT verbal,
SAT math scores, SAT scores, total GPA major GPA, and two Psy courses’ GPA. The two
datasets represent male students and female students respectively and are collected at the
same time. All these three datasets are rather small scaled and are not updated. They are
accessible through the following links:\\

\url{https://chance.dartmouth.edu/course/Syllabi/Princeton96/Dartmouth.women.html} \\
\\ With these three datasets, we could analyze to what extent does high-school GPA and SAT
scores help students succeed in colleges, and if so, which one is a more important factor.
Since we have students’ genders, we can also compare results between two genders and see
whether a significant difference exist or not.
### Datasets3: California SAT Report from 1999 to 2016
Each States in United States has its own Department of Education that creates reports on
SAT scores by district and school. Take California’s report for example. This datasets is
collected by the California Department of Education (CDE). CDE receives California students
in public schools’s SAT scores from the College Board, and then grouped the data by school,
district, country and state to produce California SAT Report. Scores for schools that had fewer
than eleven students taking the SAT are not shown on the SAT Report in order to preserve
the anonymity of the students. The report includes geographical information and a breakdown
of average SAT scores. Data attributes include school, district, county, number of takers,
average reading, writing, math scores, and percent of test takers whose total SAT scores are
greater or equal to 1500. California’s education has been growing steadily over time. With this
datasets, because we not only have numeric data, but also have SAT percentage data, we
can analyze whether California students are doing better over time. Also, since the datasets
covers a longer period of time, we could do a time-series analysis on how California’s SAT scores changed over time. Furthermore, a state-wise comparison of SAT scores may also
help us understand the fairness of admissions in United States. The data is accessible
