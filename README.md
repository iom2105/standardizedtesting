What are the determinants of high school students’ ability to succeed in college? One may argue that high school GPA is a statistically sound predictor. However, others may say that the Scholastic Aptitude Test (i.e, SAT) is a better one.

In this research project, we seek answers for the following questions: What is the relationship between SAT score and college GPA? Is high school GPA a better predictor for college GPA than SAT scores? Does this relationship apply to both males and females?
